Snake AI with BFS Pathfinding

This project is an implementation of a snake game where the snake autonomously finds its path using the BFS algorithm along with additional logic. The snake aims to eat food while avoiding collisions. The game is developed in Go using the Ebiten game library.

Note:
The project is still under development. The pathfinding algorithm requires improvements for better performance and smarter decision-making. Additionally, the codebase needs refactoring, especially in terms of naming conventions and module interactions to enhance readability and maintainability.
